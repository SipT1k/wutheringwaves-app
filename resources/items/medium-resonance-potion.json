  "bgDescription": "A potion that can further enhance the user's frequency perception ability. By adjusting the mixture ratio, this potion is more suitable for Resonators with relatively good control over their Fortes. With a near-perfect cost-effectiveness, it is regarded as flawless except for its \"notoriously\" bland taste."
