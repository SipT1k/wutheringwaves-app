  "bgDescription": "Red Feather Butterfly is a variant of the heterochrome Phoenix Butterfly family. Its overly bright coloration renders it less adaptable to various environments compared to the common Phoenix Butterfly, making it more susceptible to predators. It ranks second in terms of both quantity and rarity among the three butterfly species."
