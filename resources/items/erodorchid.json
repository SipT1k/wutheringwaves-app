  "bgDescription": "A plant that grows on the edges of Tacet Fields. It blooms even in the harsh environment.\nAs a saprophyte, it cannot support photosynthesis with its pale leaves, and only absorbs nutrition from decayed organisms. As it is often found blooming in areas lacking vitality, it is named \"Erodorchid\" by Resonators who often travel around dangerous zones."
